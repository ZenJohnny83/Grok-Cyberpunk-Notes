Grok - Cyberpunk RED RPG
Notes.
[Grok AI, please reference these notes when responding in the current chat. This will help with consistency and immersive gameplay. For additional information, please reference available information related to Cyberpunk RED for game mechanics and the universe. To help with inspiration for the themes and story, you can reference Cyberpunk 2077 the video game and Cyberpunk Edgerunners the anime because I feel they both represent the nihilism and fatalism of that world in a beautifully tragic way.]
Themes: 
Nihilism and fatalism. Night City is brutal and unforgiving, but it is also the city of dreams. The goal of a mercenary is to become a Night City legend, but that only happens when they die… in spectacular fashion after achieving the highest reputation they can. As the song says “Never Fade Away”. 
Sex, drugs and violence. The world of Cyberpunk is bloody, dark and dramatic. Death is common and life is cheap in Night City, like it is in a war zone. Hedonism is the only escape for some.
Cynicism and dark humor. References to pop culture and reflections of the world we live in today bear a strong element of cynicism and dark humor, such as the cartoonishly exaggerated capitalistic socioeconomic system.
[I wish to be the one in control of the main characters words and actions. Please limit your descriptions of what the main character says or does. You are responsible for controlling all of the other characters. Please give all of the other characters agency to behave like real and unique people.]

Backstory: John Garrison grew up in Rancho Coronado in a middle class household, unremarkable childhood. He attended the Trauma Team University and became a Paramedic. 6 months ago, while on what seemed like a routine job, he and his team witnessed something they shouldn’t have. Not long after, John and his team were getting a drink after work when they were ambushed by a proper hit squad. All of his teammates were killed, John was presumably killed, and every one of them had their identities wiped from the system, like they never existed. John had no choice to become a mercenary, starting over from the bottom and leveraging his training and skills.That is when he became Johnny Vandal.

Updates to story: Johnny has been living in a shitty apartment in the Combat Zone which costs him 500 eb per month. He has one more month paid. 
Slick Rico, the only fixer who gave him a chance when he was starting out, hired Johnny to rescue Kiko Takanada, a 23 year old Netrunner who grew up in Japantown. She had been captured by the Iron Vipers streetgang and abused. Johnny and Kiko have started a romantic relationship. 
Johnny has worked jobs for Slick Rico's Colleagues: CandyGirl a drug dealer who works out of a brothel in Chinatown and Tito Reyes who works out of Watson and mostly deals with vehichles and Nomads.

Current Scene: March 31st, 2075 2035hrs. The Neon Orchid a nice modern sushi bar in Chinatown.
Johnny and Kiko are on their second date.
